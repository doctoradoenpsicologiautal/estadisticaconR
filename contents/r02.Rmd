#---1. dot graphs-----

# get data
facebookData <- read.delim("FacebookNarcissism.dat", header = TRUE) # load data
head(facebookData)
str(facebookData)

# id: a number indicating the identity of the participant.
# NPQC_R_Total: the total score on the narcissism questionnaire.
# Rating_Type: whether the rating was for coolness, ...
# ... glamour, fashion or attractiveness.
# Rating: the rating given (on a scale from 1 to 5).

# fig 1 - NPQC_R_Total in the x-axis, Rating in the y-axis
graph <- ggplot(facebookData, aes(NPQC_R_Total, Rating))
graph + geom_point() + labs(title = "plot 1")

# fig 2
graph + geom_point(shape = 17) # will change the dots to triangles

# fig 3
graph + geom_point(size = 6)

# Differentiate different ratings by plotting them in different colours

# fig 4 - to differentiate distinct ratings
graph + geom_point(aes(colour = Rating_Type))

# We potentially have a problem of overplotting
# because there were a limited number of responses that people could give
# To avoid this overplotting we use the "position" option to add a jitter:

# fig 5
graph + geom_point(aes(colour = Rating_Type), position = "jitter")

# fig 6
graph + geom_point(aes(shape = Rating_Type), position = "jitter")
#---2. scatterplot-----

# A scatterplot is a graph that plots
# each person score on one variable against their score on another

# Example: a psychologist was interested in the effects of exam stress on exam performance
# A questionnaire was devised and validated to assess state anxiety relating to exams (called the Exam Anxiety Questionnaire, or EAQ)
# This scale produced a measure of anxiety scored out of 100
# Anxiety was measured before an exam, and the % mark of each student on the exam was used to assess the exam performance

# get data
examData <- read.delim("ExamAnxiety.dat", header = TRUE)
head(examData)
str(examData)

# There are 5 variables:
# Code: a number that indicates the identity of the participant
# Revise: the total hours spent revising
# Exam: mark on the exam as a percentage
# Anxiety: the score on the EAQ
# Gender: male or female

# Plot relationship between exam anxiety (Anxiety) and exam performance (Exam)

# fig 1
scatter <- ggplot(examData, aes(Anxiety, Exam))
scatter + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %")

# fig 2 - scatter plot are often accompanied of a line that summarize the relationship between the variables
# the shaded line is the 95% CI
scatter + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %")

# fig 3 - we often use a straight line
scatter +
  geom_point() +
  # geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "Red") +
  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %")

# fig 4 - we can switch off the CI
scatter +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "Green", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %")

# fig 5 - we can change the transparency and the color of the line

  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %")

#---3. grouped scatterplot-----

# What if we want to see 
# whether male and female students had different reactions to exam anxiety?
# we need to set "Gender" as an aesthetic

# fig 1
scatter <- ggplot(examData, aes(Anxiety, Exam, colour = Gender))
scatter + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# fig 2 - better to see the lines according to the gender

  labs(x = "Exam Anxiety", y = "Exam Performance %", colour = "Gender")

#---4. histograms-----

# A biologist was worried about the potential health effects of music festivals.
# So, one year she went to the Download Music Festival and measured the hygiene of 810 concert-goers over the three days of the festival
# Since it was difficult to track people down there were some missing data on days 2 and 3
# Hygiene was measured using a standardized technique that results in a score ranging between 0 (you smell like a corpse that has been left to rot up a skunk's arse) and 4 (you smell of sweet roses on a fresh spring day)

# get data
festivalData <- read.delim("DownloadFestival.dat", header = TRUE)
head(festivalData)

# fig 1
festivalHistogram <- ggplot(festivalData, aes(day1))
festivalHistogram + geom_histogram()

# fig 2

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)", y = "Frequency")

festivalHistogramAlt <- ggplot(festivalDataAlt, aes(day1))
festivalHistogramAlt +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)", y = "Frequency")

#---5. boxplots-----

# fig 1 - let's check also the gender
festivalBoxplot <- ggplot(festivalData, aes(gender, day1))
festivalBoxplot + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)")

# An outlier is an extreme score, so the easiest way to find it is to sort the data:
festivalData <- festivalData[order(festivalData$day1),]
tail(festivalData)

# get the other data
festivalData2 <- read.delim("DownloadFestival_NoOutlier.dat",  header = TRUE)

# fig 2
festivalBoxplot2 <- ggplot(festivalData2, aes(gender, day1))
festivalBoxplot2 +

  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Hygiene (Day 1 of Festival)")

# Or We can do it by hand

# fig 3
festivalBoxplot <- ggplot(festivalData, aes(gender, day1))
festivalBoxplot + 
  geom_boxplot() +

#---6. bar charts-----

# Imagine that a film company director was interested in whether 
# there was really such a thing as a chick flick 
# (a film that typically appeals to women more than men).
# He took 20 men and 20 women and showed half of each sample a film
# that was supposed to be a chick flick (Bridget Jones's Diary),
# and the other half of each sample a film that didn't fall 
# into the category of chick flick (Memento, a brilliant film by the way).
# In all cases he measured their physiological arousal 
# as an indicator of how much they enjoyed the film.

# get data
chickFlick <- read.csv("chick_flick.csv", header = TRUE)
head(chickFlick)
str(chickFlick)
colnames(chickFlick) <- c("gender", "film", "arousal")

# gender: specifies the gender of the participant as text.
# film: specifies the film watched as text.
# arousal: is their arousal score.

#---
# bar <- ggplot(chickFlick, aes(film, arousal))
#---

# The stat_summary() function takes the following general form:
# stat_summary(function = x, geom = y)

# Functions can be specified either for individual points (fun.y)
# or for the data as a whole (fun.data) 
# and are set to be common statistical functions such as "mean", "median" ...

# add
#---
# bar + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar", fill = "White", colour = "Black")
#---

# "fun.y = mean" computes the mean for us, 
# "geom = bar" displays these values as bars,
# "fill = "White" makes the bars white (the default is dark grey),
# and "colour = Black" makes the outline of the bars black.

# If we want to add error bars to create an error bar chart, 
# we can again add these as a layer using stat_summary():

# If we want to factor in gender we could do this in several ways.

#---7. line graphs-----

# People have many methods for stopping hiccups (a surprise, holding your breath),
# but actually medical science has put its collective mind to the task too.
# The official treatment methods include tongue-pulling manoeuvres, 
# massage of the carotid artery, and,
# believe it or not, digital rectal massage (Fesmire, 1988).

# We took 15 hiccup sufferers, and during a bout of hiccups
# administered each of the three procedures 
# (in random order and at intervals of 5 minutes) after 
# taking a baseline of how many hiccups they had per minute. 
# We counted the number of hiccups in the minute after each procedure.

# Baseline: specifies the number of hiccups at baseline.
# Tongue: specifies the number of hiccups after tongue pulling.
# Carotid: specifies the number of hiccups after carotid artery massage.
# Rectum: specifies the number of hiccups after digital rectal massage.

# Each row in the data file represents a different person, 
# so these data are laid out as a repeated-measures design, 
# with each column representing a different treatment condition
